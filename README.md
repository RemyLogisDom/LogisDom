# LogisDom


How to build with Qt 5.15.2

LogisDom needs Quazip and Qwt

Actual Quazip version used is 0.7.3, and Qwt is 6.0.2

In your Qt build project (for example /LogisDom/build-LogisDom-Desktop_Qt_5_15_2_GCC_64bit-Release)

you need to copy the Quazip source code in a folder named quazip-0.7.3, and comppile it

For Qwt is it in a folder named qwt-6.2.0

compiled library file must be stored in a folder named lib

You can do differently as you wish by modifying the LogisDom.pro file.

LogisDom should compile straight forward like this.
